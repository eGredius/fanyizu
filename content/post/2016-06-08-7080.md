**Breitbart PolitiCon Panel: Shapiro, Milo, Davi, Marlow Wage ‘Hollywood Wars’**  
**布莱巴特PolitiCon小组座谈：“好莱坞战争”**

**LOS ANGELES — If politics is truly located “downstream” from culture — as the late Andrew Breitbart was fond of saying— then three editors from Breitbart News and one Hollywood screen legend spent the afternoon on Friday knee-deep in the water, wading upstream through the muck.**

**洛杉矶报道——如果政治确实位于文化的“下游”——如已故的安德鲁·布莱巴特喜欢说的那样——那么来自“布莱巴特新闻网”的三位编辑和来自好莱坞的一位荧幕传奇人物本周五下午就是在没膝深的水中趟着淤泥逆流跋涉。**

Three firebrand culture warriors–Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Ben Shapiro, editor Milo Yiannopolous, and actor/singer/director/Big Hollywood contributor Robert Davi–took the stage Friday at PolitiCon for a panel titled “The Hollywood Wars.” Led by moderator and Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, the panel deconstructed Hollywood’s impact on politics and offered their own predictions for what that influence might look like in the future.

三位热情充沛的文化战士——“布莱巴特”高级特约编辑Ben Shapiro，编辑Milo Yiannopolous和演员/歌手/导演/“大好莱坞”栏目撰稿人Robert Davi，周五登上PolitiCon，举行了一场名为“好莱坞战争”的小组座谈。主持人由“布莱巴特”总编辑Alex Marlow担任。这次座谈解构了好莱坞对政治的影响，并就这一影响未来走向如何给出了各自的预测。

The discussion began with the idea that conservative actors, writers, producers, and executives are routinely blackballed by a hostile liberal Hollywood system–an idea that Davi, as a conservative actor with more than 130 credits under his belt, was uniquely qualified to weigh in on.

座谈首先讨论的是这样一个观点：保守派演员、编剧、制片人和监制经常遭到满怀敌意的好莱坞自由派体制的排挤。作为一个拥有130多部作品的保守派演员，Davi特别有资格就此观点发表意见。

“I would think so,” Davi confirmed, before explaining: “You’re just not invited to the party. You’re not going to the card games, or the fundraisers… All business is social, especially entertainment. ‘We’re doing this film, do you wanna be in it?’ But then if you’re not in their group, you’re not going to get it.”

“我认为确实如此，”在加以解释之前，Davi确认了这个观点：“他们不会邀请你去参加派对。你没法去打牌，也没法参加筹款会……一切行业都是社会性的，娱乐业尤其如此。‘我们要搞个电影，你想演吗？’但如果你不是他们那个圈子里的，你就没得机会。”

“Also, Hollywood is a bunch of thieves,” he added. “They’re just like politicians, they’re corrupt. You go in and say, ‘I have an idea.’ Two years later, you’ll see it on some cable network, your exact idea that’s been cannibalized in some way.”

“另外，好莱坞就是一群小偷，”他补充说。“他们就跟政客一样，一群腐败分子。你要是跟他们说‘我有个想法’。两年以后，你就能在某个有线电视上看到它了，那就是你的想法，被他们想个办法给改编利用了。”

Marlow asked Shapiro if the cultural landscape had changed significantly since the release of his 2012 book *Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV*, which examines how liberal gatekeepers use television to shape culture in America.

Shapiro在2012年出了一本书，《黄金时段的宣传：关于左派如何占领你的电视的好莱坞真实故事》，讨论了自由派看门人如何利用电视来塑造美国文化。Marlow问到，自该书出版以来，文化地景是否有了很大的改变？

“Obviously, there’s a tremendous amount of bias in Hollywood,” Shapiro said. “It’s quite open, actually. You just have to be a leftist in order to see it, because people who discriminate don’t typically tell people they’re discriminating against that they’re victims of discrimination.”

“显然，好莱坞存在巨大的偏见，”Shapiro说。“实际上，这是相当公开的。只是你需要是个左派才能看到这一点，因为歧视者通常并不会告诉被歧视者说他们是歧视受害者。”

Shapiro added that in Hollywood, “it’s not a question of leftist versus conservative, it’s a question of human versus non-human.”

Shapiro补充说，在好莱坞，“问题就不是左派vs. 保守派，而是人类 vs. 非人。”


> You either agree with the people in Hollywood, which makes you human, or you disagree with the people in Hollywood which means you’re somewhat less than human. And the typical kind of litmus test right now is gay marriage. If you’re pro-gay marriage, then you’re a wonderful and decent human being. If you’re anti-gay marriage, then you’re a Nazi. And you will not work.
> 
>  “要么你同意好莱坞的人，那样的话你就是人；要么你不同意好莱坞的人，那样的话你就比人低一等。目前典型的试金石就是同性婚姻。如果你支持同性婚姻，那你就是个善良体面的好人。如果你反对同性婚姻，那你就是个纳粹分子。并且你没法工作。
> 
>  There are certain positions you can hold as a conservative, abortion is getting closer to acceptable in Hollywood if you’re pro-life, but if you’re someone who believes that traditional marriage is superior to homosexual marriage, then that is obviously springing from your inherent bigotry, and you must be cast out like a leper.
> 
>  “作为一个保守派，有些立场你可以持有，比如如果你反对堕胎，那么好莱坞只是个对堕胎变得更宽容的地方，但如果你相信传统婚姻比同性婚姻要优越，那这显然源自你内在的顽固偏执，必须要像对待麻风病人一样把你驱逐。”
> 
>  By now, the rather large room hosting the panel on the second floor of the Los Angeles Convention Center had begun to fill up.

这时候，举办座谈的这间位于洛杉矶会议中心二层的颇为宽敞的会议室已经开始坐满。

The conversation swung to Lena Dunham and the notion that Hollywood insists on forcing Americans to care about hyper-liberal, “hip” actresses even when [nobody watches their shows](http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/02/10/ratings-crash-lena-dunhams-girls-hits-all-time-low/). Yiannopoulos said that millennials, the very target demographic that Dunham’s show *Girls* looks to capture, especially don’t care about her show, or about any TV, for that matter.

讨论转到了Lena Dunham身上，大家论及这样一个想法：好莱坞坚持强迫美国人去在乎那些狂热自由派的“嬉皮”女演员，即使压根没人看她们的表演。Yiannopoulos说，“千禧一代”，也正就是Dunham的电视剧《衰姐们》想要吸引的目标人口群体，恰好特别不关心她的剧，当然其实他们是不关心任何电视。

“[Millennials] are not in the slightest bit interested in tuning into her show,” Yiannopoulos said.“They’re not interested in anything, not *Empire*, not *Breaking Bad*. Hollywood doesn’t have the same purchase over them.”

“千禧一代压根对她的电视剧没有一丝一毫兴趣，”Yiannopoulos说。“他们对一切都不感兴趣，管他《嘻哈帝国》也好，《绝命毒师》也好。好莱坞对他们无能为力。”

Instead, he argues, they’re increasingly playing video games and creating content themselves, most of it on the Internet. But even video games have come under fire from leftist social justice elements, something Yiannopoulos has spent much of the past year documenting. And even though the video game industry is now bigger than Hollywood, Yiannopoulos lamented that, as with Hollywood, the political right is “letting it go” on video games.

他认为，取而代之的是，他们现在越来越多玩电子游戏、自己制作内容，而且大都在网上完成。不过，即使是电子游戏也已经处于左派社会正义分子的炮火之下，Yiannopoulos去年有很长一段时间就在记录这个现象。尽管电子游戏产业现在比好莱坞还大，Yianopoulos却哀叹，跟好莱坞一样，政治右派在电子游戏上也在“放手”。

“The left is engaged in this process of attacking gamers and readers for imagined sins like racism, sexism, and transphobia on the basis that playing a game online can make you a worse person in real life,” he said. “[The right] is not fighting on video games.”

“左派正在以想象的罪名攻击游戏玩家和读者，诸如种族主义、性别歧视和变性恐惧，理由是玩在线游戏能让你在现实生活中变坏，”他说。“右派并没有在电子游戏问题上进行反击。”

The discussion then focused on the tools of narrative, which the panel agreed have a conservative bias.

随后，讨论聚焦于叙事工具，小组成员一致认为，现在的叙事工具对保守派存在偏见。

“The left has taken all these right-wing tropes that they reject, and then they turn around and use them in their films,” said Shapiro. “The left uses the right’s tools and the right uses the left’s tools, and the right loses with the right message and the wrong tools, and the left wins with the wrong message and the right tools.”

“左派已经把所有他们反对的右派使用的修辞手法占为己有，然后一转身将之用到了自己的电影中，”Shapiro说。“左派用了右派的工具，右派则用左派的工具。右派用正确的信息加上错误的工具而失败了，左派则用错误的信息加上正确的工具而成功了。”

“I look at it through a whole different prism,” added Davi. “In the past you had films like *Death Wish* and *Dirty Harry*. There’s something I have to go back to, when Cecil B. DeMille made the *Ten Commandments*. That was a big cultural moment; Judeo-Christian values at its apex… When that *Noah* film came out, there was a secularization in that experience.”

“我是透过一个完全不同的棱镜来看待这一点的，”Davi补充说。“过去，我们有像《猛龙怪客》和《警探哈里》这样的电影。有种东西我必须回头去找，回到Cecil B. Demille制作《十诫》的时候。那可是个重大的文化节点；犹太—基督教价值观达到了顶峰……当《诺亚》那部电影出来的时候，影视界经历了一次世俗化。”

Still, Yiannopoulos sounded an optimistic note when he suggested that “culture is moving in a good direction,” mostly due to the rise of video games. He argued that, unlike Hollywood, video games promote conservative and libertarian values that are “baked into” the experience.

不过，Yiannopoulos还是发出了一个乐观的音符，他认为，主要由于电子游戏的兴起，“文化正在向一个好的方向前进”。他认为，电子游戏与好莱坞不同，保守派和自由意志主义的价值观“植入了”在玩游戏的体验中并得以推广。

“There’s very little you can do to break that, however much messaging, however many paraplegic Armenian lesbians you put on Level 17,” he added. “There is a limit to how many leftist tropes and messages you can shoehorn in to a game about killing prostitutes, or shooting space aliens.”

“不管在游戏中出现多少信息，不管在游戏关卡里放多少半身瘫痪的美国女同，都很难取得左派想要的效果”他补充说。“对于一个内容是杀害妓女或者射杀太空外星人的游戏，能往里头塞的左派修辞和信息毕竟有限。”

Because politics are truly downstream from culture, the conversation was destined to end up on Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump.

由于政治确实位于文化的下游，讨论就注定要以共和党总统竞选领跑者Donald Trump作为最后一个话题。

Davi praised Trump’s “authenticity” and said he’d recently been in New York City, where he’d heard both a Pakistani taxi driver with six kids and women in their 20s and 30s say they were for Trump.

Davi赞扬了Trump的“真实”，并说他最近刚到过纽约市，他在那听到一个有6个孩子的巴基斯坦的士司机和一群20或30多岁的女士，都声称自己支持Trump。

“If I was looking at all these politicians like I was an acting coach, and they’ve all said the same thing; one speaks like a Harvard law degree that’s been well-prepped… and I’ve heard them say the right things, and do nothing! They get in office, and do absolutely not a thing.”

“如果我把自己当成一个表演教练来看这些政客，那么他们所有人说的都是一样的；都是那种准备良好的哈佛法律学位获得者的说话方式……我听他们说过各种正确的话，却没做任何事！他们上台了，然后绝对不做任何事。”

“Trump captures the imagination of the public,” Davi added. “There’s a likability factor that’s unconscionable.”

“Trump抓住了大众的想象力，”Davi补充说。“他有种不合情理的可爱因素。”

“His name recognition makes a massive difference, because when you know someone, you’re willing to cut them some slack,” added Shapiro. “Everybody feels like they know Trump. He’ll never sink below 15 percent in the polls, kind of like Hillary.”

“他的知名度影响很大，因为如果你认识某人，你就会愿意对他加以优待，”Shapiro补充说。“人人都觉得自己认识Trump。他的民调绝对不会掉到15%以下，这有点像Hillary。”

Yiannopoulos said millennials particularly connect with Trump because his campaign has tapped into the generation’s defining characteristics of mischief, joy, and a ridicule of the establishment.

Yiannopoulos说千禧一代跟Trump特别有共鸣，因为他的竞选已经契合了这一代人的本质特征，即胡闹、欢乐和对体制的嘲弄。

“He’s almost a comment section come to life, and I mean that as a compliment,” Yiannopoulos said. “What I mean is he’s feisty, he’s irreverent, he’s rude: I think the guy’s brilliant. He speaks the way we all speak, if only we could get away with it. Look at the [political] figures who are rising and who are more popular than ever: they reject the language policing of the left.”

“他几乎就是个活的留言板，我说这个是表示赞扬，”Yiannopoulos说。“我的意思是，他很活跃，很不敬，很粗鲁；我觉得这人太赞了。他说话就跟我们没顾忌地说话一样，但我们会有种种顾忌。看看那些正在上升的和比以往任何时候都更受欢迎的（政治）人物：他们拒绝左派的语言监督。”

Milo added that the left’s preferred tactic for ending debate, by branding their opponents “racist” or “transphobic,” is becoming increasingly ineffective as the cultural climate slowly changes: “When they come at you and call you a misogynist, or a racist, or a transphobe, nothing bad happens if you just laugh at them. In fact, people will like you even more. And I think Trump is tapping in to that natural sense of defiance and mischief and irreverence that people now feel.”

Milo补充说，随着文化气候的缓慢变迁，左派最爱用的一个用于结束辩论的伎俩——给他们的对手贴上“种族主义者”或“变性恐惧”的标签——现在正日益丧失效果。“当他们走过来把你称作厌女者，或种族主义者，或变性恐惧，如果你只是笑话他们一下，就不会有什么后果。事实上，人们会更加喜欢你。我认为Trump正在迎合人们现在感受到的那种蔑上、胡闹和不敬的自然意识。”
