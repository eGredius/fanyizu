**Surrendering to Death**  
**向死亡投降**

Eagles of Death Metal recently finished a Canadian tour and I got to sit down with vocalist Jesse Hughes and discuss the Bataclan attack in Paris that killed 89 of his fans. You’d think he’d want to avoid the topic, but he was actually eager to get into it. He sees it as a catharsis.

死亡金属之鹰乐队最近结束了一个加拿大巡演，我有机会和主唱Jesse Hughes坐下来讨论巴黎的Bataclan剧院惨案。该事件中，他的89位粉丝惨遭杀害。也许你认为他想回避这一话题，但他其实很渴望提到它。他将此视为一种宣泄。

Hughes is not happy with the way the media has treated the story. Details are randomly pulled from his interviews and entire angles are edited in later that are diametrically opposed to his beliefs. Jesse Hughes has been [ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-devil-and-jesse-hughes-the-donald-trump-supporting-drug-hoovering-frontman-for-eagles-of-death-metal-will-not-apologize-for-anything/). He’s pro-gun, pro-Trump, and pro-life. He recognizes that Islam is the problem and political correctness is literally killing us.

Hughes 不满意媒体对待该故事的方式。他访谈中的细节被随意抽出，整个视角随后则被编写成与他的信念截然相反。Jesse Hughes 已经被任命为普世生命教会的牧师【译者注：该宗教流派鼓励行善，并允许牧师保持其原有信仰，无论是基督教、伊斯兰教和无神论等。】。他支持持枪权，支持川普，也反对堕胎。他认为伊斯兰教才是问题所在，而政治正确正在真真切切的杀死我们。

**Takimag: It’s hard to talk about the attack without sounding like you’re blaming the victims, but it’s impossible to deny fear of Islamophobia and fear of guns led to a lot of deaths that night.**

**Taki杂志：谈论这次袭击，却避免听起来像是指责受害者，是很难的。但是不能否认的是：对伊斯兰恐惧症的恐惧，和对枪支的恐惧，导致了那晚很多人的死亡。**

Jesse Hughes: I saw fear fall like a blanket on the whole crowd and they fell like wheat in the wind—the way you would before a god. I was totally alert from the very beginning. The first thing I needed to do was find my girl. Fear took a backseat and “where’s my girl?” took over.

Jesse Hughes：我看见恐惧如毯子一样盖在整个人群上，人群倒伏在地，如风中的麦子——就是那种面对上帝你会下拜的姿态。我从一开始就非常的警觉。首先，我需要做的是找到我的女朋友。恐惧退居第二位，而“我的女朋友在哪”则位居第一。

I could smell gunpowder in the backstage area and I knew someone fired a round back there. I saw a guy with an FAL and when he turned to face me his eyes looked like marbles. He was stoned out of his mind, and we now know they were on Xanax and cocaine. I recognized him. I’d seen him earlier in the day and noticed him staring at us.

我可以在后台区域闻到火药味，我知道某人往那边打了一梭子。我看见一个配有轻型自动步枪的人，当他面朝我时，他的眼睛看起来像玻璃弹珠一样。他整个呆住了，现在我们知道他们当时是嗑了蝴蝶丸和可卡因。我认出了他。当天早些时候，我看到过他并注意到他盯着我们看。

**They were in the venue early. That implies some staff were in on it.**

**他们早先就在会场。这意味着有些工作人员参与了此事。**

I got in a lot of trouble for [saying that](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jesse-hughes-bataclan-security-had-a-reason-not-to-show-up-20160310). I know for sure that they were in there early. I remember them staring at my buddy. I just chalked it up to Arab envy. You know what I mean? When a Muslim sees a cocky American dude with tattoos, he stares at him.

因为声称这点，我遭遇了很多麻烦。我很肯定他们早先就在那里。我记得他们盯着乐队成员看。我当时认为那只是阿拉伯式的羡慕。你懂吧？当一个穆斯林看到一个臭屁的纹着身的美国哥们，他就盯着那人看。

I realized later it was [Abdeslam](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3320070/The-deadly-blunders-run-Paris-terrorist-centre-international-manhunt-stopped-released-French-police-Belgian-border-hours-deadly-attacks.html) and he was staring at my buddy because they thought he was a threat. There’s no denying the terrorists were already inside, and they had to get in somehow. During the shooting I went outside and the backstage door was propped open. How did that happen?

之后我意识到那人是 Abdeslam【译者注：袭击参与者之一】。他盯着我哥们看，因为他们认为他是个威胁。无可否认，恐怖分子已经混进里面了，他们必须用某种法子混进去。在枪击中，我跑到外面去，而后台的门是大开着的。这是怎么发生的？

**Do you think political correctness is killing our natural instincts and making us vulnerable?**

**你认为政治正确正在杀死我们的自然直觉，并使得我们变得易受攻击吗？**

Definitely. There were two girls who were involved. They were at the venue and vanished before the shooting, and these women were in traditional Muslim garb. They knew people wouldn’t check them because of the way they were dressed. They got caught a few days later.

当然。有两个女孩参与了此事。她们曾在大厅里，但在枪击前又消失了。这些女士穿着传统穆斯林服装。他们知道因为她们的穿着，人们不会检查她们。几天后她们被抓获。

**The fear of offending Muslims is a terrorist’s greatest weapon.**

**害怕冒犯穆斯林的心态是恐怖分子最有力的武器。**

Look at the guys who bombed Brussels. They were wearing black gloves on one hand. Their luggage was too heavy to lift, but they didn’t want anyone helping them with it. Nobody brought any of this up until after the bombs went off.

看看那些在布鲁塞尔放炸弹的家伙。他们一只手带着黑手套，他们的行李太重举不起来，但是他们不想让任何人帮助他们搬行李。直到炸弹爆炸后才有人把这些线索联系起来。

**We’d rather die than be called a bigot.**

**我们宁死也不愿意被称作是偏执狂。**

How is a faith being associated with racism? Just take out the word “Islam” and replace it with “communism.” It’s an ideology. The same way the Rosenbergs could sell nuclear secrets from within America is the same way Muslim terrorists can attack us from within. It’s okay to be discerning when it comes to Muslims in this day and age.

一种信仰是如何被和种族主义联系起来的？只要把“伊斯兰”一词抽掉，换成“共产主义”。这就是一种意识形态。和卢森堡夫婦出卖美国的原子弹机密一样，穆斯林恐怖分子也从内部袭击我们。今时今日，一旦涉及到穆斯林，小心一点没错。

**Where is this push coming from? Is it all our fault?**

**这动机从何而来？都是我们的错吗？**

Of course not. When you’re at a soccer game in Europe and you see the words “United Arab Emirates,” you know there is a lot of Arab money floating around and influencing the dialogue. The conversation is constantly being steered away from scrutiny. They think we’re fools.

当然不是。当你在欧洲的足球赛场看到阿联酋一词，你就知道有很多阿拉伯资金流入并影响了交流。这一交流始终得以避开审慎的检视。他们觉得我们是白痴。

Arab money is a pollutant. So many movies are made with Arab money. George Clooney doesn’t kiss the ass of the Arabs for no reason. American movies are the best way to influence the hearts and minds of the world.

阿拉伯资金是一种污染物。如此多的电影是在阿拉伯资金的支持下拍摄的。乔治·克鲁尼不是无缘无故跪舔这些阿拉伯人的。美国电影是影响这世界的心灵和思想的最佳方式。

**You never see bad guys in movies who are Arab terrorists. It’s always Germans or French…**

**电影中，你从来看不到阿拉伯恐怖分子作为坏人出现。总是德国人或者法国人。**

Or conservative Christian rednecks. They’re apparently what’s wrong with everything in the world now, including global warming. What about the other ice age we went through? There were no Christian Republicans back then. What caused that meltdown?

或者保守的红脖子基督徒。他们显然是这个世界当下各种麻烦的根源，包括全球变暖。那我们经历过的那个冰河时代呢？那时候可没有基督徒共和党人。那是什么导致了这场灾难呢？

**The other problem with that is, when you get rid of these Christian rednecks, you create a vacuum and it gets filled with people way worse. It gets filled with Islam. You end up replacing evangelism with sharia law.**

**另一个麻烦是，如果你排挤走这些红脖基督徒，你就创造了一个真空，让更糟糕的人来填补。伊斯兰填补了这真空。你的结局就是用伊斯兰教法代替福音主义。**

Politicians behave better when they know people are watching. We behave better when we believe Jesus is watching us.

当知道人们在监督时，政客们的行为更规矩。当相信耶稣在看着我们时，我们的行为更规矩。

**These atheists tell us we don’t need religion, yet everyone seems to be creating flimsy substitutes to replace it. Rehab is just Lent. Meditation is just Latin Mass. Seeing a therapist is just talking to your priest.**

**那些无神论者告诉我们，我们不需要宗教，不过每个人似乎都在创造轻浮脆弱的替代品来代替宗教。修复期实际是大斋期【译者注：在西方基督教国家，每年的大斋期是基督徒献供与苦修的时期，也是洗涤罪恶，承蒙天主启示的时期】。冥想实际是拉丁弥撒。去看治疗师实际上是和你的牧师谈话。**

And the thing about the Bible is it’s written down. A therapist can change his diagnosis just like that and there’s no way of calling him out on it.

而圣经，就是那些被写了下来的（治愈谈话），它不像一个治疗师可以任意更改其诊断，而且人们无法在这事上挑战他。

**Let’s get back to the attack. Why didn’t the cops come in earlier? It seemed like the killing went on forever.**

**让我们回到袭击这个话题。为什么警察不能更早来呢？当时看起来杀戮好像会永远进行下去。**

The press heard some kids were locked away in rooms so they reported it as a hostage situation. Those kids were hiding. This misinformation meant the cops set up outside for a negotiation while inside dozens of people were dying.

媒体听说一些小孩被锁在房间里，所以他们当时把这事当作人质危机报道。那些小孩在躲藏。这种信息误导意味着警察在外面准备谈判，而内部的数十人则正在死去。

The terrorists would go up to bodies and stick them with the gun. If they budged, they’d shoot them again. One girl got up and said she was scared. The guy said, “Don’t be scared, you’ll be dead in two minutes,” and then he shot her, BOOM.

恐怖分子们会走近倒下的人，用枪戳他们。如果倒地者动了，就会被补枪。一个女孩爬了起来，说她很害怕。一个恐怖分子说“别怕，你在两分钟内就会死。”然后他开枪打了她，砰。

**The French are so concerned with racism, they’re letting Muslims get away with murder.**

**法国人太在意种族主义，他们让穆斯林逍遥法外。**

A day after, at the stadium, Muslims booed the moment of silence and we barely heard about it in the press. I saw Muslims celebrating in the street during the attack. I saw it with my own eyes. In real time! How did they know what was going on? There must have been coordination.

一天后，在球场上，穆斯林在默哀时刻发出嘘声，而我们很少听到关于这一情节的媒体报道。袭击的时候，我看到穆斯林们在街上庆祝袭击。我亲眼看到这事。就在袭击的那个时刻。他们怎么知道袭击正在发生？这些事情一定有联系。

**I’ve heard you say you credit your childhood with your survival. You had a real dad who stuck around and taught you about guns.**

**我听说你提到你的童年经历帮你幸存了下来。你有个陪伴你的父亲，而且教给你关于枪支的知识。**

I knew what gunfire was. I was able to think through it. I was also able to remember practical lessons of my life because I had to be in fights as a kid. My mom didn’t go sue anyone. I didn’t have playdates. I had some practical upbringing growing up in the desert where you got to get yourself out of your problems.

我知道开枪是怎么回事。我能把这事考虑清楚。我也能记起我生活中的实际经验，因为我小时候不得不参与打架。我妈妈没有起诉任何人，我也没有大人给我找的玩伴。我有些实际成长经验，在孤立无援的困境中你只能靠你自己走出来。

Also, the reason I’ve done well with this healing process is everything I was raised to believe was affirmed that night. In a way, that’s a blessing of God. When the first bullets started being fired, people looked at me. I remember that. It pissed me off because I knew right then and there it was going to be bad. I knew these kids had no idea what was coming. None. They’d never heard a gunshot in real life and it hit them so hard.

而且，我从此事件中恢复的如此之好的原因是，我长大成人过程中得到的一切信念都在那一晚被肯定了。某种程度上，这是神的保佑。当第一颗子弹出膛，人们看着我。我记得这点。这让我愤怒，因为就在那刻那地我知道事情要坏了。我知道那些孩子们对即将发生的事情毫无概念。没有一个知道。他们从未在现实生活中听到过一声枪响，这重重的打击了他们。

**Political correctness kills.**

**政治正确在杀人。**

Davey [bassist Dave Catching] was in the middle of the stage and when the lights went on, he saw shit he’d never seen before in his life, [awful stuff](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3320420/Joyous-crowd-wave-smile-enjoy-Eagles-Death-Metal-concert-just-moments-89-murdered-ISIS-gunmen.html). It has no parallel. It’s not just death. It’s the most unsuspecting, innocent victims you can imagine—people who are gripped in terror and can’t move as a result of it.

当灯光开启时，Davey（贝斯手Dave Catching）在舞台中间，他看到了他此生从未见过的可怕场景，可怕极了。没什么可以与此相比。不仅仅是死亡。那是你可以想象的最无辜最没有防备的受害人——人们被笼罩在恐怖中呆若木鸡。

**It’s like a metaphor for all of Western civilization.**

**这好像是所有西方文明的一个隐喻。**

I watched about seven people die. A couple of them were three feet from the barrier. They could have fallen backwards and been alive but they were too scared to even turn around. I remember a woman just standing with her hands up in a surrender pose. The terrorist finally saw her and all she did was go, “No no no.” She surrendered to death in front of my very eyes. I was yelling at her, “HEY!” and I don’t think she could hear me. She was so terrified, I think she’d already given up.

我目睹了大约七个人死亡。他们中一些离护栏就三英尺远。他们也许能翻越护栏逃生，但他们太害怕了甚至不敢转身。我记得一个女人就站在那里，高举双手作投降状。恐怖分子终于看见了她，而她只是一味的说“不，不，不。”就在我的眼前，她向死亡投降了。我向她呐喊，“嗨！”。我不认为她听到了我。她如此害怕，我想她已经放弃了。

**Is it fair to say the liberal mentality created this need to surrender?**

**说自由派的精神气质创造了投降的需要，合理吗？**

I will lay the blame right in its lap. When you tell people they can’t help themselves and that they’re children, you weaken them to a point where three feet away is life and they can’t see it because they’re too scared.

对，我要责怪的正是他们。当你告诉人们他们不能自助，他们只是孩子，你就把他们变弱到一个连三英尺远的逃生机会都看不到的地步。他们看不到，因为他们太害怕了。

In a way we’re unarmed two fold. We’re literally unarmed and we’re also mentally unarmed.

某种程度上我们是双倍的赤手空拳。我们本来就赤手空拳，而且我们在精神上赤手空拳。

It’s like the bleating sheep from Animal Farm. You suggest anything that strays from the narrative and this chorus of bleats comes to drown you out. This attack didn’t happen by accident.

就像《动物庄园》中懦弱哀嚎的绵羊。当你的观点脱离叙述的主流，这懦弱哀嚎的合唱就把你的声音盖过。这个袭击不是偶然发生的。

**I went to Paris after the attacks and was disgusted by the lack of rage. They didn’t blame Islam. In fact, many blamed the Jews. They seemed more concerned with us promoting xenophobia than laying blame on the terrorists.**

**我在袭击后去过巴黎，并对缺乏愤怒的程度感到恶心。他们没有谴责伊斯兰。事实上，很多人指责犹太人。比起指责恐怖分子，他们似乎更关心我们促进仇外情绪。**

I hung out with plenty of Parisians who were fucking pissed off, but it was mostly cops and military. During the attack, one cop finally realized it wasn’t a hostage situation and yelled out, “It’s a turkey shoot” as he charged in, holding his gun. He got shot right through the hand and into the neck and kept going. He took a terrorist out, chased another one into the hallway, who then blew himself up, and did it to another guy, who blew himself up on stage. Our amplifiers were a gory mess.

我和很多出离愤怒的巴黎人交流过，但是这些主要都是警察和军人。在袭击期间，一个警察终于意识到这不是人质劫持，他持枪突入，并且大叫，“这是土耳其射击！”。他被子弹穿过手，击中脖子，仍然进击。他撂倒了一个恐怖分子，在走廊追击另一个。那恐怖分子就自爆了。之后又追击另一个，那人在舞台上自爆。我们的扩音器上血肉模糊。

**Did that cop live?**

**那警察生还了吗？**

Yes, I met him in triage. I hung out with him. Great guy.

是的。我在急救站见过他。我们后来又聚了一次。很好的人。

**You went to the hospital?**

**你进医院了？**

I had pieces of teeth and human bone pulled out of my face. A girl got shot right next to me by the shooter at the top of the stairs who I had met earlier. She stepped one step in front of me and her head just exploded. It blew pieces of her teeth and skull into my face.

从我的脸上取出了牙齿和人骨碎片。我旁边的女生被楼梯顶上我早先见过的枪手击中了，她在我面前踉跄了一下，接着她的头爆开了。她的牙齿和头骨碎片扎进了我的脸。

**Why don’t we hear about this?**

**为何我们没听到此事？**

The media wants to summarize it, and important details get lost. The most important detail being when they started shooting, they were already inside. If they were hanging out enough to let three people go, then they knew security dudes. They knew bouncers. They knew doormen.

媒体想要总结事件，而重要的细节则丢失了。最重要的细节是，在他们开始射击时，他们早已经混入内部了。如果他们让三个人混入都能保持隐蔽，那他们一定认识保安。他们认识门卫。

**Do you think a percentage of the security staff was Muslim?**

**你认为有一定比例的保安人员是穆斯林？**

I know they were. Look, security guards backstage are notorious for being dicks. They check your ID every few minutes and nobody goes back and forth without being checked, even if you’re in the band. This guy didn’t care what we did. He didn’t even look at me.

我知道他们其中一些是。听着，后台保安一般以严格著称。他们没几分钟就会查验你的证件。没人能不被检查来回穿梭，即使你是乐队的一员。而这次后台保安则不管我们是干什么的，他甚至没看我。

The only time he seemed remotely interested in us was when he said to my girlfriend, “Do you speak French?” and “Where are you from?” She said she was from Texas and he was getting frustrated because that’s not what he meant. Then she said, “I’m American” and he lost interest. I honestly think he was trying to determine if she was Arab or not. She’s Mexican and she could easily pass for Lebanese and I think he was going to warn her if she was Muslim.

唯一一次他看来对我们稍有兴趣是他问我女友“你说法语吗？”以及“你从哪里来？”她说她从德州来，而他则感到沮丧，因为这不是他所要问的。然后女友说“我是美国人。”他就失去了兴趣。坦率的说，我认为他试图判定她是不是阿拉伯人。她是个墨西哥人，很容易被错认成黎巴嫩人。我认为如果女友是穆斯林，他当时会警告她。

I kept opening up the back door to smoke and that’s usually a big no-no because of the sound ordinances. I’ve played there before and opening up that door to smoke got you in big trouble. This time, the security guy walks right past me and anxiously looks down the alleyway in either direction.

我让后门开着以便抽烟，通常这是绝不允许的，因为噪声管制。以前我在这里演奏过，开门抽烟会给你带来大麻烦。这次，保安径直从我身边走过，焦虑的打量通道的各个方向。

**Maybe one of the reasons the cops are so much more pragmatic about this threat is that they are the ones who have to go into Les Banlieues and confront these people. Naïveté is a luxury they can’t afford.**

**也许对恐怖威胁，警察的态度现实得多的原因之一是，他们正是那些要去市郊移民聚居区，面对穆斯林的人。幼稚是他们负担不起的奢侈品。**

When the cops went in after the attack, they shut down, what, 450 mosques? They found recruitment material in every single one of them. What the fuck is wrong with us that we don’t know about that?

当袭击后警察进入聚居区时，他们沉默了，什么，450个清真寺？他们在它们中的每一个都发现了招募材料。我们到底是怎么了，竟然不知道这事？

**Parisians think everyone is innocent, but the cops don’t. They even investigated you.**

**巴黎人认为每个人都是无辜的，但是警察不这么想。他们甚至会调查你。**

I was a person of interest, yes. They interrogated me for four days. I ended up helping them a lot by getting cell-phone footage. It was the cops and the FBI who asked me about the promoter and the security. This isn’t something I brought up to them.

我是个需要被调查的人，是的。他们盘问了我四天。最终我通过现场手机视频帮了他们很多。是警察和FBI问了我关于演出组织者和保安的问题。这不是我提出来的。

We had eight police officers in our audience that night. They all had the same conversation with their wives, which was “Should I bring my gun or not?” All of them said no. When we went back and played Paris again they stood in the same places they stood at the original show and they opened their jackets and showed me their guns as if to say, “Not tonight, motherfucker.” It was beautiful.

当晚观众中有八个警察。他们全都和太太有过相同的对话，“我应该带枪吗？”。太太们全都说不。当我们回到巴黎再次演出的时候，他们站在我以前演出时他们站过的地方，而且他们打开外套，向我展示他们的枪，好像在说，“今晚狗杂种们休想再搞事”。真赞。

**Islam is crying wolf about Islamophobia in order to anesthetize us and make us easier prey.**

**对伊斯兰恐惧症，伊斯兰教不断叫嚷“狼来了”，为了麻痹我们，使我们更容易被猎杀。**

They know there’s a whole group of white kids out there who are stupid and blind. You have these affluent white kids who have grown up in a liberal curriculum from the time they were in kindergarten, inundated with these lofty notions that are just hot air. Look at where it’s getting them.

他们知道有一大群白人孩子都是愚蠢和无知的。有大堆的白人孩子自幼儿园起，就成长于自由派课程中，沉浸在热空气般虚无不切实际的幻想中。看看这些白孩子将要面对的吧。
