description: "巴尔的摩状况之糟糕令人触目惊心，不仅仅是犯罪率高的问题，整个社会似乎已陷入螺旋式堕落的漩涡，希望过一种正常生活并且有能力去寻找正常生活的人，都已经或正在逃离，那么，巴尔的摩，还有其他类似状况的城市，究竟是怎么走到这一步的？"

**Whose Fault is Baltimore****？**  
**巴尔的摩骚乱谁之过？**

I’ve seen the liberal lying MSM pondering how WE could allow the riots, looting, burning and lawlessness to happen, as if it is our collective fault. Obama stands before his teleprompter and pontificates about the need for us to end the poverty that supposedly led to Purge Night in Charm City.

我看到那些满嘴跑火车的自由派主流媒体成天思考**我们**（又被代表）怎么能容忍暴动、抢劫、纵火和无法无天，就好像这是整个城市的错。奥巴马站在他的提词器前武断地宣称消除贫困的必要，似乎这贫困将会导致“净化之夜”在这魅力之城上演。【译注：电影《净化》中，未来的美国变成了一个极权的警察国家。每年的3月21日晚7点到次日早7点被称作净化之夜，在此期间所有的暴力犯罪都是合法的。】

That term cracks me up. The city has so much charm, its football team once snuck out of town overnight and headed to Indianapolis. It has so much charm its baseball team was forced to play a game with no fans in the stands.

这情景让我反胃。这座城市是如此有魅力，它的橄榄球队曾半夜溜出城跑到印第安纳波利斯去；它如此有魅力，它的棒球队曾被迫在没有一个球迷的球场上打比赛。

I think most people can agree that Freddie Gray, a petty drug dealer, was killed in police custody for the crime of looking suspicious. The policemen who killed him deserve to go to jail for murder. As usual, the powers that be circled the wagons and intended to exonerate the hero first responders.

我想大部分人都会同意，Freddie Gray——一个小混混毒贩子——仅仅因为看起来可疑而被捕并在羁押期间遭到杀害。那些杀害他的警察理应为谋杀而坐牢。同往常一样，权贵们对此事会引起的风波早有准备，并且打算赦免那英雄的第一响应者【first responder，指突发状况时首先到场的警察、医护人员等。】。

The people of Baltimore had a right to be pissed. They had a right to protest. They didn’t have a right to burn businesses and cars. They didn’t have the right to riot, loot, and injure others.

巴尔的摩的人们有权感到愤怒，他们有权游行示威。但他们没有权利去焚烧商场和汽车，他们没权利暴乱、抢劫和伤害他人。

It is the police department created and controlled for decades by Democratic progressive politicians that has committed the atrocities against the people who have been electing these progressives year after year. Baltimore has a corrupt, reckless, out of control police department enabled by a crooked and incompetent Baltimore politicians. The rap sheet for Baltimore’s finest is long:

由民主党的进步派政客创建并控制了数十年的警察局屡屡犯下暴行，而人们年复一年地把这些进步派选上台。巴尔的摩有个腐败的、厚颜无耻的、失控的警察局，全靠一群腐败无能的政客得以运转。巴警察局干过的好事可不少：

* Police commissioner Ed Norris was sent to prison on corruption charges (2004)
* 2004年警察局长Ed Norris因为腐败而于锒铛入狱。
* Two detectives were sentenced to 454 years in prison for dealing drugs (2005)
* 2005年两位警探因为贩毒而被判刑454年。
* An officer was dismissed after being videotaped verbally abusing a 14-year-old and then failing to file a report on his use of force against the same teenager (2011)
* 2011年一位警官对一名14岁少年言语虐待并被拍摄下来，而后他无法书面解释为何对同一位少年使用武力，最终被解职。
* An officer was been fired for sexually abusing a minor (2014)
* 2014年，一位警官因为性虐待未成年人而被开除。
* The city paid a quarter-million-dollar settlement to a man police illegally arrested for the non-crime of recording them at work with his mobile phone.
* 巴市曾付过一笔25万美元的庭外和解费，只因警员们非法拘捕一位拿手机拍摄他们执法的男士。
The cries of racism and white oppression ring hollow. It’s a tired storyline. Facts are always inconvenient to race baiters with an agenda to extract more money from whites with a guilty conscience and the inability or unwillingness to speak the truth. Let’s examine some facts about good old Charm City, USA.

对种族主义和白人迫害的哭诉是空洞无力的，这也是陈词滥调了。对种族迫害论者而言，事实真相往往不合时宜，他们总是试图通过白人的负罪感、在说出真相上的无能或不情愿，来攫取更多的钱财。让我们来看看巴尔的摩这传说中的“魅力之城”都有哪些丰功伟绩吧。

* The fine citizens of this metropolis have not elected a Republican as mayor since 1963, before the War on Poverty began. That mayor’s 4 year term is the only interruption in Democrat rule since 1947. They have had Democrat control for 64 of the last 68 years, and sole control for the last 48 years straight.
* 自打1963年起，巴市的良民们就没有选出过哪怕一位共和党的市长，那时“向贫穷开战”还未开始【War on Poverty，指美国第三十六任总统林登·贝恩斯·约翰逊推行的一系列福利法案。】从1947年起，市长的4年任期限制就是民主党统治的仅有停顿。68年间，民主党主政了64年，过去的48年民主党更是大权独揽。
* Their mayor is black. Their previous mayor, Sheila Dixon, was black. She was convicted of embezzlement in 2010 and couldn’t finish her term. They had a white mayor (current Democratic Presidential hopeful Martin O’Malley) for eight years. The mayor before him was black.
* 他们的现任市长是黑人。他们的前任市长，Shiela Dixon,是黑人。她因为在2010年挪用公款而未能干满任期。他们曾有过一个干了八年的白人市长（如今民主党的热门总统竞选人Martin O’Malley）。在他之前，市长也是黑人。
* Their City Council consists of 15 members. All fifteen are Democrats. The Council President is black. Democrats have had control of legislation in Baltimore for the last 50 years. Every program, policy, initiative, or school curriculum that exists in Baltimore was enacted by liberal Democrats.
* 他们的市议会由15名成员组成，15人全是民主党。市议会的主席是黑人。过去50年，民主党控制了巴市的立法，巴尔的摩的每一个项目、政策、动议，甚至学校课程，都是由自由派民主党人制定颁布。
* The Police Commissioner is black. Approximately 50% of the police force is black.
* 警察局长是黑人。大约一半的警察也是黑人。
* The School Superintendent is black, along with the School Board. The district has an annual budget of $1.32 billion to teach 84,000 kids. The Baltimore school system ranks second among the nation’s 100 largest school districts in how much it spent per pupil at $15,700 per student. Only NYC spends more. Only two thirds of students graduate high school, despite this high level of spending.
* 校监是黑人，全体校董会也是黑人。学区每年拥有13.2亿美元预算作为84000个孩子的教育经费。在全美最大的100个学区中，巴尔的摩的教学系统花在每个学生身上的经费位列第二，平均每人高达15700美元，只有纽约市花得比这更多。尽管有如此高的花销，只有三分之二的学生从高中毕业。
* The average SAT scores of Baltimore City public school students are: 379 in Reading; 376 in Math; 381 in Writing. These are the scores of the best of the best in Baltimore schools who actually think they should get into college. The average scores in the country, which still suck, are around 500. Students with these scores have about a 15% chance of graduating college. This is the ROI you get after spending $188,000 per student over their 12 year academic career.
* 巴市公立学校学生的SAT成绩平均为：阅读379分，数学376分，作文381分。这还是那些自认应该进入大学的顶尖学生的分数。全国的平均分，虽然低但也有500左右。有着这成绩的学生有15%的机会从大学毕业。这就是在一个学生12年的学习生涯中花掉188000美元的投资回报率。
* The population of Baltimore is 623,000 and 63% are black. Median household income is $41,000, with 24% living below the poverty line. The home ownership rate is 48%. The percentage of college graduates is 27%.
* 巴市有623000人口，其中63%是黑人。每户人家的年平均收入是41000美元，24%的家庭生活在贫困线以下。48%的人拥有自己的房屋。只有27%的人是大学毕业生。
* The population was 950,000 in 1950, so it has fallen by 35% in the last 65 years. The population was 24% black in 1950. Decades of liberal Democrat policies drove most of the white population out of the city.
* 1950年的人口总数是950000，过去65年降低了35%。1950年黑人占人口总数的24%。数十年来民主党的政策将大多数白人赶出了这座城市。
* Baltimore’s violent crime rate is 370% higher than the U.S. rate. They have over 200 murders, 300 rapes, 3,600 robberies, 4,600 assaults, 7,800 burglaries, and 22,000 thefts per year. These are all 2 to 4 times the U.S. averages per 100,000 people.
* 巴市的暴力犯罪率是比全美水平高出3.7倍。这里一年发生200起命案、300起强奸案、3600起抢劫案、4600次人身伤害、7800起入室抢劫和22000起盗窃案。每一项都是全美每十万人平均犯案率的二至四倍。
* Over 35% of all Baltimore residents get food stamps. Over 85% of the kids get free breakfasts and lunches at school. More than 60% of Baltimore residents are receiving some form of government assistance.
* 超过35%的巴市居民领取食物救济券。超过85%的小孩在学校领取免费的早晨和午餐。全市超过60%的居民领取政府发放的某种救济。
* Baltimore’s welfare paradise is paid for by outrageously high taxes. It’s income tax rate of 3.2% is on top of the state rate of 4.75%. It’s property tax rate is more than double the other counties in Maryland. The sales tax rate is 6%. Corporations pay an income tax rate of 8.25%.
* 巴市的这种福利天堂是靠高得离谱的税收支撑的。个人所得税在州税率4.75%的基础上额外多收3.2%。。它的财产税比马里兰州其他郡的两倍还高。它的消费税为6%。公司要付的所得税为8.25%。
* The percentage of out of wedlock births to black women in Baltimore exceeds 72%. Baltimore and Detroit are the two cities with populations over 600,000 with the highest percentage of single parent households – 59% to 61%.
* 在巴市，黑人妇女婚外生育的比例高达72%。巴尔的摩和底特律都有超过60万的人口，它们的单亲家庭比例也是全美最高——分别为59%和61%。
* The reported unemployment rate for Baltimore is 8.2%, one of the highest in the country. In reality, 42% of the working age population is not working. Young black men between the ages of 20 and 24 have a reported unemployment rate of 37%. But in reality, it is north of 60%. The number of employees in 1990 totaled 475,000. Today they total 365,000, down 23%.
* 据报道，巴市的失业率为8.2%，为全国失业率最高的城市之一。事实上，42%的适龄人口都没有工作。20至24岁的黑人男性失业率据报道为37%，事实上远远不止60%。1990年，雇员的总数为475000，今天这个数字为365000，下降了23%。
It doesn’t take a village to raze, burn, and loot a village. It just takes 50 years of liberal economic and social policies. Of course the liberal media, liberal politicians, and liberal voters don’t think anyone should be blamed for the disaster that Baltimore and every other Democrat controlled urban shithole (Detroit, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Atlanta, Cleveland) have become over the last 50 years.

毁掉一个村子无须全村出力【编注：此处取典于一句非洲谚语“[It takes a village to raise a child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_takes_a_village_to_raise_a_child)”，意思是为孩子成长提供文化环境的是整个社区，而非仅仅是个体家庭】，50年的自由派经济和社会政策足矣。当然，自由派媒体、政客和选民并不认为谁应该为过去50年巴尔的摩以及其他（底特律、费城、圣路易斯、亚特兰大、克利夫兰）民主党控制下的都市粪坑里所发生的灾难而受责难。

Community organizer Adam Jackson, living up to the standards of Organizer in Chief Obama, declared that in Baltimore “the Democrats and the Republicans have both failed.” At least progressive community organizers have a sense of humor. How can Republicans have failed if the mayors and City Council have been 100% Democrat since the mid 1960s? I wonder how many Republicans were among the youths burning, looting, and destroying the city this week.

社区组织者Adam Jackson倒是挺合奥巴马老大对组织者的口味，他宣称在巴尔的摩“民主党和共和党都是失败者”。至少这些人还挺幽默的，当巴尔的摩的市长和市议会从60年代中期开始便全是民主党人，共和党的失败倒是从何说起？我倒是想知道在这周的青年纵火、抢劫和破坏活动中有几个共和党参与。

No Republican, and definitely no conservative, is responsible for the poverty, crime, educational failure, and disintegration of this lesson in Democratic rule. Baltimore’s police department is the product of the progressive wing of the Democratic party, enabled by black identity politics. This is entirely a left-wing Democratic creation. They get all the credit for what Baltimore has become. The mayor of Baltimore is an incompetent bumbling fool. These corrupt, arrogant left wing boobs are incapable of running a school system, police department, or economy.

没有共和党，当然更没有保守主义，这便是贫穷、犯罪、教育失败和民主党秩序崩溃的原因。巴尔的摩警察局就是民主党进步派的造物，奉行的是黑人本位政策。这完全是左翼民主党人的杰作，巴尔的摩的今天全拜其所赐。巴尔的摩市长就是个无能蠢货。这些腐败的、自以为是左翼笨蛋根本无力让教育系统、警察局或是城市经济正常运转。

They know how to play race politics to get elected. They know how to increase taxes on the few remaining producers in order to redistribute it to their black voters. They know how to destroy businesses and jobs. They know how to create a welfare mindset among black people, enslaving them in poverty, dependency, and ignorance. Blacks have suffered the most from Democratic black rule.

他们知道怎么打好种族这张牌来当选。他们知道如何对仅存的几个企业征税，好把财富重新分配给他们的黑人选民。他们知道怎么毁掉商业和工作岗位。他们知道怎么让黑人对福利上瘾，用贫穷、依赖和无知去奴役他们。民主党的“黑人统治”给黑人带来的伤害恰恰最大。

These riots will result in less businesses, less jobs and less taxes for the city. Blacks will be hurt the most, but they will continue to vote for Democrats. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Believing liberal welfare policies will fix the problems created by liberal welfare policies is insane. Liberalism is a disease of the brain and has infected a vast swath of America, especially in urban enclaves across the land.

这些暴乱将让这座城市的商业、工作岗位和税收越来越少。黑人将最受伤，但他们还是会给民主党投票。疯狂的市民总是种下同样的因却期盼着不同的果。相信自由派的福利政策会解决自由派福利政策带来的问题，这就是疯狂。自由主义是一种观念疾病，并已经感染了一大帮美国人，尤其是那些在城市孤岛里的居民。

Baltimore and every other Democrat controlled urban enclave in America are destined for decline, destruction, and civic decay. Baltimore cannot be fixed by spending more money on welfare programs. The country has spent $22 trillion on anti-poverty programs since LBJ declared his war on poverty.

巴尔的摩和其他民主党控制下的城市孤岛注定会衰败、毁灭、民生凋敝。靠在福利项目上花更多钱救不了巴尔的摩。自林登·约翰逊总统宣布“向贫穷开战”以来，这个国家已经花了22万亿美元在消除贫困的项目上了。

They haven’t moved the dial on poverty one iota. They have created generations of dependent black people, trapped in urban ghettos like Baltimore. If you can’t educate children for $15,700 per year, then you won’t educate them any better for $18,000 per year. Liberals will never admit their policies, programs, and corrupt practices created this national disaster.

他们在贫穷问题上毫无建树。他们培养了一代代习惯于依赖的黑人，这些人便被困在像巴尔的摩这样的贫民窟里。如果你一年花15700美元教育不好一个小孩，那你一年花18000美元也无济于事。自由派不会承认他们的政策、项目和腐败的作风导致了这个全国性的灾难。

Liberal welfare policies have encouraged and rewarded out of wedlock births. The 72% black out of wedlock birth rate is the single biggest cause of Baltimore’s long-term decline. Children without fathers are destined to be uneducated, unemployed, and underachieving. Children raised by married working parents who provide good role models are not on the streets. They are studying. They are not looting, killing, robbing or having kids when they are teenagers.

此外，自由派的福利政策无疑鼓励了非婚生育。72%的非婚生育率是巴尔的摩长期衰败的最大缘由。没有父亲的孩子们注定无法受到良好教育、注定失业并一事无成。那些双亲都有工作且能为表率的孩子们是不会在街头游手好闲的——他们要学习。他们不会去抢、去杀，不会十几岁就为人父母。

There are no guarantees in life, but being stupid, lazy and ignorant guarantees a life of poverty. Liberal welfare policies pay these people to have more kids out of wedlock in order to maximize their welfare payments. There have now been three generations of black people entrapped by these demented welfare programs.

没有什么能担保你有一个好的生活，但愚蠢、懒惰和无知却保准让你的生活一贫如洗。自由派的福利政策付钱给这些人，好让他们非婚生育更多的孩子以获得最多的福利款。已有整整三代黑人被困在这些疯狂的福利项目之中。

There is no will among the recipients or distributors of race based welfare payments to change their policies or programs. Therefore, every time a white cop kills a black person or a white store owner kills a black thief in Baltimore or any urban ghetto, the potential for riots, looting, and burning of businesses will rear its ugly head.

福利款的接受者或是发放者都没有意愿去改变这些基于种族的福利政策或项目。因此，在巴尔的摩或其他某个城市贫民窟，每当一个白人警察杀死一个黑人或是一个白人店主杀死一个黑人小偷，骚乱、抢劫、纵火等丑恶行径便会抬头。

The only guarantee is the liberals running the urban ghetto will not accept blame for what they have wrought. Farewell to the America of personal responsibility, work ethic, marriage, family, and valuing education.

唯一确定的是，控制这些城市贫民窟的自由派是不会接受任何对他们所犯好事的批评的。向那个推崇个人责任、勤勉美德，赞美婚姻、家庭并珍视教育的美国道别吧！

The esteemed mayor of Baltimore Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (of course a liberal black woman must hyphenate her name) summed up the disease of liberalism after her peeps had destroyed their neighborhoods the night before:

我们尊敬的巴尔地摩市市长Stephanie Rawlings-Blake（哦，当然，一个自由派的黑人妇女的名字中自然会有连字符，以显示她已婚或来自少数族裔）在其同胞于昨晚破坏了他们的社区后，这样总结自由主义的病症：


> *“It’s a very delicate balancing act, because while we tried to make sure that they were protected from the cars and the other things that were going on, we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well.”*
> 
>  **“（警方的行动）有一种微妙的平衡，因为当我们试图确保抗议者不被车流和其他来往的东西伤害的同时，也给了那些想要搞破坏的人以机会。”**
> 
>  You reap what you sow America.

你们曾在美国大地播撒下那些种子，如今正在收获它们结出的果实。
