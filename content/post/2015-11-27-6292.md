**How big is the average penis?**  
**丁丁的平均尺寸**

“I was in the pool!” George Costanza’s distress at the “shrinkage” of his penis after exiting a cold pool was hilarious in the 1994* Seinfeld* episode, but for many men concern over the length and girth of their reproductive organ is no laughing matter. Now, a new study could assuage such worries with what may be the most accurate penis-size measurements to date.

“那是因为我刚从冰冷的池子里出来！”在1994年播出的一集《宋飞传》里，可怜的男主角George Costanza在被朋友嘲笑萎缩的丁丁后，懊恼地大叫。这一幕成了《宋飞传》经典的搞笑桥段，但对许多男士来说，生殖器的长短粗细可不是闹着玩的。现在，有一份最新研究也许能平抚男士们的担忧。这份研究里的丁丁尺寸测量数据也许是迄今为止最为精确的。

Many earlier studies relied on self-reporting, which doesn’t always yield reliable results. “People tend to overestimate themselves,” says David Veale, a psychiatrist at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. So when Veale and his team set out to settle the score on penile proportions, they decided to compile data from clinicians who followed a standardized measuring procedure.

在此之前，许多研究都依赖自行报告的数据，结果往往并不可靠。“人们倾向于高估自己。”David Veale说。Veale是英国国民保健属（NHS）-南伦敦及莫兹利信托基金的精神病学家。所以当Veale和他的团队着手评估阴茎尺寸时，他们决定采用来自临床医生的数据，因为医生们会遵照一个标准的测量程序。

Published today in the *British Journal of Urology International*, [their new study synthesizes data from 17 previous academic papers that included measurements from a total of 15,521 men from around the world](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/bju.13010). The data enabled the researchers to calculate averages and model the estimated distribution of penile dimensions across humanity.

他们今天发表在《英国国际泌尿学杂志》上的研究报告综合了之前17份学术论文的成果，包括对全世界15521名男士的测量数据。这些数据让研究人员得以计算出阴茎大小的平均值，并对人类阴茎尺寸的大致分布建立模型。

“It still just strikes me how many men have questions and insecurities and concerns about their own penis size. We actually do need good data on it,” says Debra Herbenick, a behavioral scientist at Indiana University, Bloomington, who was not involved in the study.

Debra Herbenick说，“如此多的人对自己的阴茎大小抱有疑问、不安全感和关切，这让我颇为惊奇。我们真是需要一份靠谱的数据。”Herbenick是印第安纳大学伯明顿分校的行为科学家，并未参与这份研究。

According to the team’s analysis, the average flaccid, pendulous penis is 9.16 cm (3.61 inches) in length; the average erect penis is 13.12 cm (5.16 inches) long. The corresponding girth measurements are 9.31 cm (3.66 inches) for a flaccid penis and 11.66 cm (4.59 inches) for an erect one.

根据Veale团队的分析，阴茎松弛下垂时平均长9.16cm（3.61英寸），勃起时长13.12cm（5.16英寸）；相应的，阴茎松弛时的平均周长为9.31cm（3.66英寸），勃起时的周长为11.66cm（4.59英寸）。

A graph of the size distribution shows that outliers are rare. A 16-cm (6.3-inch) erect penis falls into the 95th percentile: Out of 100 men, only five would have a penis larger than 16 cm. Conversely, an erect penis measuring 10 cm (3.94 inches) falls into the 5th percentile: Only five out of 100 men would have a penis smaller than 10 cm.

从尺寸分布图上我们可以看到异常值是很少的。一根勃起时16cm（6.3英寸）长的阴茎已处在第95个百分位处：100个男人中，只有5位的阴茎勃起长度大于16cm。相反，一根勃起时10cm（3.94英寸）长的阴茎位于第5个百分位：100个男人中只有5位的阴茎勃起长度小于10cm。

[![sn-penisdimensions-REV](https://headsalon.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sn-penisdimensions-REV.png)](https://headsalon.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sn-penisdimensions-REV.png)Gentlemen, if you’re eager to see how you measure up, you’ll need to follow the same measurement procedure used in the study. All length measurements were made from the pubic bone to the tip of the glans on the top side of the penis. Any fat covering the pubic bone was compressed before measurement, and any additional length provided by foreskin was not counted. Circumference was measured at the base of the penis or around the middle of the shaft, as the two sites were deemed equivalent.

先生们，如果你很想知道自己“长方几何”，那你就需要依照研究中采用的测量方法去测量。长度均从耻骨测起，到阴茎上方的龟头顶端。覆盖耻骨的脂肪在测量前应被压平，包皮延伸的长度都概不作数。周长则是测量阴茎根部或中部，一般两者的数值相等。

The researchers concluded that there was no strong evidence to link penis size to other physical features such as height, body mass index, or even shoe size. Yes, it seems that the only definite conclusion that can be drawn about a fellow with big socks is that he probably has big feet.

研究者们得出结论：并没有有力证据表明，阴茎的大小同诸如身高、体重指数或脚的大小等其他体征相关。是的，对于一个穿大号袜子的哥们，你唯一能确定的似乎只是他有双大脚。【译注：西方有“脚大鸟大” 之说。】

Likewise, the study found no significant correlation between genital dimensions and race or ethnicity, although Veale points out that their study was not designed to probe such associations, because much of the data used were from studies of Caucasian men.

同样，该研究也没有发现生殖器的大小同种族或民族有何显著联系。不过Veals也指出，他们的研究并不是为揭示此种联系而设计的，因为他们采用的大量数据都是来自针对白人的研究。

It’s easy to laugh at poor George Costanza for his shrunken manhood, but some reports suggest that only about 55% of men are satisfied with their penis size. Some seek potentially dangerous surgical solutions to a problem that, according to Veale, is often only in their head. Men “seem to have a very distorted picture of what [size] other men are, and what they believe they should be,” Veale says.

嘲笑可怜的George Costanza那泄了气的命根固然轻松，可一些报告显示只有55%的男性满意自己的丁丁尺寸。一些男人求助于有潜在风险的外科手术来解决“问题”，而这一“问题”——依Veals之见——只不过是他们臆想出来的罢了。男人们“似乎对其他男人的尺寸、自己该有的尺寸，有非常扭曲的看法。”Veals说道。

Pornography, in which male performers are often selected for their extremely large genitalia, may be partly to blame. Similarly, Herbenick points to the myriad spam e-mails that assert that 17.78 cm (7 inches) is average for an erection, when in reality such a member would place its owner in about the 98th percentile. It’s best to just ignore those ads in any case, Veale says. “There are no effective lotions or potions or pills.”

也许色情作品难辞其咎，那里面的男演员通常都是经过挑选的，生殖器尺寸大得惊人。Herbenick指出，那些宣称17.78cm（7英寸）才是勃起丁丁平均长度的垃圾邮件也是满天飞的祸害，而实际上17.78cm已位于第98个百分位了。Veale 说，无视这些广告就好了，“没有什么神油和猛药，统统不管用。”
